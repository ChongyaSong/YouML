## INTRODUCTION
The macOS application resides in this repository is named `YouML` which stands for “`You`r (free) `M`achine `L`earning (toolkit).” It intends to provide the machine learning community a `free` and `no-code` toolkit for preprocessing data and building machine learning models. Several key features will be released after no major bug can be found in the current version. The ultimate goal is to deliver a `platform` where users can obtain `solutions` to address tough problems in their machine learning tasks.

| Task  | The number of algorithms  | Extra Information |
| :------------ |:---------------:| -----:|
| Data Cleaning | 3 | N/A |
| Feature Selection | 3 | N/A |
| Data Preprocessing | 35 | unlimited SQL queries |
| Data Splitting | 4 | unlimited SQL queries |
| Machine Learning | 50 | 23 for classification <br /> 27 for regression |

## PERFORMANCE

## TARGET GROUP
YouML is designed for `entry-to-mid` level users (prior knowledge of statistics is desirable), sophisticated users could purchase cloud-based machine learning products from tech giants (e.g., Microsoft, Google, Amazon) if they need such an automation toolkit.

+ Entry-level
    * machine learning learners (e.g., students)
	* programmers who intend to build and incorporate machine learning models into their programs
+ Mid-level
	* users who intend to utilize YouML as a data preprocessing toolkit and feed the preprocessed data into their model scripts
	* users who expect to pinpoint top-N machine learning models in terms of accuracy and/or efficiency (so that they can focus on N models when composing their model scripts)
	* small businesses that eager to gain insights from their data 

## PLAN
A preliminary technical solution to accomplish the aforementioned ultimate goal has been determined, which also includes `Windows` and `Linux(ready-to-release)` versions. I will make every effort and try to look for others to ensure on-schedule completion. What I pursue is to create an application that is/with (a):
- Toolkit & `Solution hub`
- Script-level flexibility
- No-code & Low learning curve
- Free

## CONTACT
As a personal project, I `do realize` that YouML has numerous bugs because it has `never` been tested any user. Therefore, I’m eager to hear about your experiences - bug reports, feature requests, questions and suggestions are very welcomed.

## INSTALLATION
YouML adopts the same installation approach as common Python packages (i.e., run a setup.py script), so experienced users may skip this section and directly install YouML in their preferred manners.

Downloading the entire repository and uncompressing it as a folder `YouML-main`. YouML runs on top of nearly 50 dependencies which can be installed by two package managers:
1.	Conda (recommended)
2.	Pip3

Although it is easier to install dependencies using pip3, I still recommend `beginners` to install everything through conda due to the following reasons:
1.	PyPI (i.e., Python official package repository) is currently inaccessible via pip3 due to security threats. Consequently, you have to find alternative tools or search & install dependencies manually if there is something wrong with dependencies (e.g., version conflict).
2.	Pip3 installs dependencies in a serial and recursive way, so no effort is made to ensure the compatibilities among dependencies are fulfilled simultaneously.
3.	The prerequisite of using pip3 is to install a Python3 interpreter on your local machine. If the version of the installed Python3 interpreter is lower than 3.7.11, YouML is unable to drop features/columns via SQL queries and you have to search & install a new one to fulfill this requirement. Different interpreters reside in the same environment may result in conflicts and/or confuse you when using.

### Instruction (conda)
1. Installing Anaconda or Miniconda (recommended) by following the instruction below. Beginners could download and use any installer (excluding ARM-based) to simplify the installation.<br />
https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/macos.html

2. Opening a command prompt/terminal and navigating to the uncompressed folder `YouML-main`.<br />
   Reminder: installing YouML outside the folder YouML will result in `ModuleNotFoundError`).

3. `conda config --append channels conda-forge`<br />
This command enables your conda to download dependencies from conda-forge repository because a few dependencies and/or specific versions are not available in the default repository.

4. `conda create --name YouML --file Dependency.txt --yes`<br />
This command creates a new conda virtual environment named “YouML” (case-insensitive) in which all dependencies are installed.

5. `conda activate YouML`<br />
This command brings you into the conda virtual environment YouML.

6. `python3 setup_conda.py install`<br />
This command installs YouML into the conda virtual environment, which can be launched by command: “YouML” (case-insensitive). Reminder: the prerequisite of launching YouML in this manner is to enter the conda virtual environment YouML (i.e., step No.5).

### Instruction (pip)
1. Installing a Python3 interpreter with a version of 3.7.11 or later (pip is included by default).<br />
https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Opening a command prompt/terminal and navigating to the uncompressed folder `YouML-main`.<br />
   Reminder: installing YouML outside the folder YouML will result in `ModuleNotFoundError`).

3. `python3 setup_pip.py install`<br />
This command installs YouML and the associated dependencies on your machine.

### Instruction (optional but `highly recommended`)
`which YouML | xargs -I {} cp {} /Applications`<br />
This command creates a copy of YouML executable in folder /Applications. Now, you can drag & drop it anywhere (e.g., dock) and open it by clicking.

## TOTURIAL
Reminder: ARM-based Macs may wait for minutes when starting YouML for the first time (due to the binary translation performed by Rosetta 2), but it only takes seconds to start YouML afterward.

### 1. Auto-save
YouML is able to track and save your most-updated progress automatically, so there is no save button and data will not loss unless YouML is quit forcibly.

### 2. Availablility of sidebars
The availablility of sidebars on each panel is shown in the table below. To trigger a sidebar, you should move the pointer to the corresponding edge/border.
| Sidebar / Panel  | Experiment  | Data | Sampling | Processing | Splitting | Model
| :------------ |:---------------:|:---------------:|:---------------:|:---------------:|:---------------:|:---------------:|
| Workflow (left)   | √ | √ | √ | √ | √ | √ |
| Table (bottom)    |   | √ | √ | √ | √ |   |
| Feature Selection (right) |   |   | √ | √ |   |   |

### 3. Creating a branch for an experiment
You may run into the following situation during data preprocessing: you are very satisfied with the conducted manipulations so far, however, you have different ideas for the next steps and would like to compare the accuracy of models result from different data. Achieving it through repeatedly undo and redo multiple manipulations is apparently a bad practice. Fortunately, YouML allows you to create a branch for an experiment by clicking a button next to the experiment name, which works in the following way:

Assume an experiment has conducted 3 data manipulations: original data ---1---> data_1 ---2---> data_2 ---3---> data_3<br />
After creating a branch, both of the experiment and its branch are starting/attached with/to `data_3` (i.e., original data).<br />
Reminder: if you choose another data in data panel, the new data will be employed in creating a branch because Auto-save is always tracking your most-updated progress (refer to USAGE No.1).

### 4. Terminating redundant plotting and useless data loading
The employed plotting library Matplotlib is not designed for real-time display, but for generating publication-quality figures. By default, a small figure associated with each feature is produced and filled into a table at the bottom after each preprocessing manipulation. As a result, YouML may take more than 10 seconds to draw all `colorful` figures (refer to the second paragraph of USAGE No.3) if the numbers of samples and features exceed 50,000 and 50, simultaneously. It is the fact that the small figures are not that informative due to the limitation of the size. Therefore, YouML also visualizes each feature in separate 6X-larger widgets and doesn’t generate these redundant (i.e., small) figures when the product of #samples and #features is greater than 2.5e6 (i.e., 50,000 times 50). The 6X-larger figures are publication-quality (i.e., ppi = 300) and are generated within a few seconds even if the number of samples exceeds 1e5.

Furthermore, samples are also loaded into the table after each preprocessing manipulation. However, users would refer to summary and statistical information instead of specific samples when preprocessing big data in practice. Consequently, YouML allows users to manually turn off the data loading and the figure plotting features.

### 5. Adaptive data visualization algorithm
You may find some of the small figures are different from the corresponding large ones. This is not caused by a bug, but result from a built-in `adaptive data visualization algorithm`. In short, the algorithm is able to mine data pattern from various perspectives by adjusting 6 decoupled parameters (will be available in YouML). As a result, users may discover more valuable patterns, generate more informative data and build more accurate models.

In addition, if the number of unique target values doesn’t exceed 20 (configurable in future versions), the large figures are colorful and each color represents one value, otherwise, the large figures are plain. This is due to a fact that users may not gain useful information from complicated figures. 

On the other hand, the labels on each axis are separately replaced by unique letters if the number of labels exceeds 26 or the conjunction of all labels is longer than the corresponding axis. The mapping relation between labels and letter can be found in a list adjacent to figures.
